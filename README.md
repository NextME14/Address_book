# Address_book
This consists of a database to store the contacts of a user under  any identification name needed by the user. This system has the basic functions as in most Address Books  like Add, Delete, Update and Search. We have managed to add  extra features to these basic functions. For example; when  searching for a particular contact the user is given a choice to  look for it either by its name, number, or the first letter(s) of  the contact. Included below are the attachments for the rest of the  improvements. Python was used as the programming language. Pycharm 2021  was the IDE used and MYSQL as the database service.
